        <section class="content1">
            <h1 style="font-size:xx-large;">How do we know about the climate is changing?</h1>
            <img class="graph" src="graph.jpg">
            <p style="font-style:italic;font-size: large;">This graph, based on the comparison of atmospheric samples contained in ice cores and more recent direct measurements, provides evidence that atmospheric CO2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution.

            <p>Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.</p>
            <h1>11 SIGNS OF CLIMATE CHANGE</h1> 
            
            <ul >
                <li>Higher Temperatures</li>
                <li>Changing Rain and Snow Patterns</li>
                <li>More Droughts</li>
                <li>Warmer Oceans</li>
                <li>Increased ocean Acidity</li>
                <li>Shrinking Sea Ice</li>
                <li>Melting Glaciers</li>
                <li>Less Snowpack</li>
                <li>Rising Sea Level</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>HIGHER TEMPERATURES</h2>
            <p>Greenhouse gases are trapping more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which is causing average temperatures to rise all over the world. </p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>Temperatures have risen during the last 30 years, and 2001 to 2010 was the warmest decade ever recorded. As the Earth warms up, heat waves are becoming more common in some places, including the United States. Heat waves happen when a region experiences very high temperatures for several days and nights.</p>
            
            <h2>CHANGING RAIN AND SNOW PATTERNS</h2>
            <p>As temperatures rise and the air becomes warmer, more moisture evaporates from land and water into the atmosphere. More moisture in the air generally means we can expect more rain and snow (called precipitation) and more heavy downpours. But this extra precipitation is not spread evenly around the globe, and some places might actually get less precipitation than they used to get. That's because climate change causes shifts in air and ocean currents, which can change weather patterns.</p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>On average, the world is already getting more precipitation now than it did 100 years ago: 6 percent more in the United States and nearly 2 percent more worldwide.

                The effects vary by region, though. For example, states in the Northeast are getting more precipitation than they used to get, but Hawaii is getting less.</p>

            <h2>MORE DROUGHTS</h2>
            <p>A drought is an extended period of dry weather caused by a lack of rain or snow. As temperatures rise due to global climate change, more moisture evaporates from land and water, leaving less water behind. Some places are getting more rain or snow to make up for it, but other places are getting less.</p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>Since the 1970s, droughts have become longer and more extreme worldwide, particularly in the tropics and subtropics.</p>
            
            <h2>WARMER OCEANS</h2>
            <p>The atmosphere affects oceans, and oceans influence the atmosphere. As the temperature of the air rises, oceans absorb some of this heat and also become warmer.</p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>Overall, the world's oceans are warmer now than at any point in the last 50 years. The change is most obvious in the top layer of the ocean, which has grown much warmer since the late 1800s. This top layer is now getting warmer at a rate of 0.2°F per decade.</p>
            
            <h2>INCREASED OCEAN ACIDITY</h2>
            <p>Carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere whenever people burn fossil fuels. Oceans play an important role in keeping the Earth's carbon cycle in balance. As the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises, the oceans absorb a lot of it. In the ocean, carbon dioxide reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid. This causes the acidity of seawater to increase.</p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>Over the last few decades, the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean has increased all over the world, and so has ocean acidity.</p>
            
            <h2>SHRINKING SEA ICE</h2>
            <p>The Arctic Ocean around the North Pole is so cold that it is usually covered with ice. In the winter, the area covered by ice gets bigger, and in the summer it gets smaller. If the air and water are warmer than usual, Arctic sea ice will melt more than usual during the summer.</p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>The amount of summer ice in the Arctic Ocean in recent years was the smallest it's been since scientists started using satellites to measure the area covered by ice back in the 1970s. The ice is also getting thinner.</p>
            
            <h2>MELTING GLACIERS</h2>
            <p>Glaciers are large sheets of snow and ice that are found on land all year long. They're found in the western United States, Alaska, the mountains of Europe and Asia, and many other parts of the world. Warmer temperatures cause glaciers to melt faster than they can accumulate new snow.</p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>Glaciers all over the world have been melting for at least the last 50 years, and the
                rate of melting is speeding up. Many glaciers in Alaska and other parts of the United
                States have shrunk dramatically.</p>
            
            <h2>LESS SNOWPACK</h2>
            <p>Snowpack refers to the total amount of snow and ice on the ground. In high mountain ranges and other cold places, snowpack builds up in the winter and melts in the spring and summer. As the world gets warmer, some places will get more rain instead of snow, so the snowpack won't be as deep. Plus, when the air is warmer, snow melts faster.</p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>Many places have less snowpack than they used to, and this snowpack is melting earlier. For example, the map on the right shows that in many parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, snow doesn't stay on the ground in the spring as long as it used to.</p>
            
            <h2>RISING SEA LEVEL</h2>
            <p>As water gets warmer, it takes up more space. Each drop of water only expands by a little bit, but when you multiply this expansion over the entire depth of the ocean, it all adds up and causes sea level to rise. Sea level is also rising because melting glaciers and ice sheets are adding more water to the oceans.</p>
            <h3>What happening now?</h3>
            <p>Over the past 100 years, the average sea level around the world rose by nearly 7 inches.</p>
